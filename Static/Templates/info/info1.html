                <h1 class="TitleInfo">DSN (deep space network) </h1>
                <p class="infotxt">The Deep Space Network or DSN is the world's largest and most sensitive scientific telecommunications system. It consists of three facilities equipped with high-tech antennae strategically located in Goldstone, Madrid and Canberra. This placement allows constant links to distant spacecraft even as the Earth rotates on its own axis.

                    <br>The antennae receive data and transmit commands. To listen to the weak signals from the spacecraft, they are equipped with high-tech amplifiers, but unfortunately, there are a few issues regarding their functionality. First off, the signal becomes downgraded by background radio noise or static emitted naturally by the rest of the matter in the universe. This noise is further amplified by the signal. The second mishap is that the powerful electronic equipment used for amplification adds noise on its own.
                    
                    <br>Nowadays, the solution uses highly sophisticated technology, such as cooling the amplifiers to a few degrees above absolute zero and using special techniques to encode signals so that the receiving system can distinguish the signal from background noise.
                    
                    <br>What do you have in mind to solve these issues?
