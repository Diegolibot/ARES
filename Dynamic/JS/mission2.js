Whenever we need to report something, we go with them, because they love talking with their friends on Earth. One of them is in Spain, another one in the United States and the third one is in Australia. They seem very far away, but they are always connected."],

This is an analogy to asking the others to be quiet, since what they do at the antennae is ignore the background noise, which in this case is the noise made by the neighborhood."],
